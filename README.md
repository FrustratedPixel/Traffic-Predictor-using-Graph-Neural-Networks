# Traffic-Predictor-using-Graph-Neural-Networks
Graph neural networks sparked my interests as they dont operate on the euclidean space. So i figured i will do a project on it to learn more about them.

The ML4RoadSafety paper piqued my curiosity related to the traffic prediction part so i searched for a small scale dataset and created a small scale version of it so i could learn about GNNs.

I tried implementing them in both Tensorflow and pytorch but the pytorch had some CPU/GPU data issues that i've yet to fix.
